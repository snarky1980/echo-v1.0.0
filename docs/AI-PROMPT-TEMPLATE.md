## Common AI Mistakes and How to Fix Them

### Mistake 1: Using Wrong Quote Escaping

**AI Output (WRONG):**
```csv
body_en,"She said \"hello\" to the client"
```

**Corrected:**
```csv
body_en,"She said ""hello"" to the client"
```

**Fix:** Replace `\"` with `""` (double-double-quotes)

---

### Mistake 2: Inconsistent Variable Names

**AI Output (WRONG):**
```csv
subject_fr,Bienvenue <<ClientName>>
subject_en,Welcome <<Client_Name>>
variables,ClientName;Client_Name
```

**Corrected:**
```csv
subject_fr,Bienvenue <<ClientName>>
subject_en,Welcome <<ClientName>>
variables,ClientName
```

**Fix:** Ensure exact same variable name (case-sensitive) in all languages

---

### Mistake 3: Line Breaks Not Wrapped in Quotes

**AI Output (WRONG):**
```csv
body_fr,Bonjour,

Nous vous remercions.
```

**Corrected:**
```csv
body_fr,"Bonjour,

Nous vous remercions."
```

**Fix:** Wrap entire multi-line field in double quotes

---

### Mistake 4: Wrong Variable Placeholder Syntax

**AI Output (WRONG):**
```csv
subject_fr,Projet {ProjectName} - Mise à jour
subject_en,Project $ProjectName - Update
```

**Corrected:**
```csv
subject_fr,Projet <<ProjectName>> - Mise à jour
subject_en,Project <<ProjectName>> - Update
```

**Fix:** Use `<<VarName>>` syntax consistently

---

### Mistake 5: Including Markdown Code Blocks

**AI Output (WRONG):**
````
Here's your CSV:

```csv
id,category,title_fr
test_template,Test,Template test
```

I hope this helps!
````

**Corrected:**
```csv
id,category,title_fr
test_template,Test,Template test
```

**Fix:** Extract only the CSV content, remove all markdown and explanations

---

## Advanced Tips

### Tip 1: Batch Processing

For large datasets, split into smaller chunks:
- Process 10-20 templates at a time
- Review each batch before merging
- Easier to spot and fix errors

### Tip 2: Iterative Refinement

Start with structure, then refine:
1. First pass: Generate IDs, categories, titles
2. Second pass: Add descriptions
3. Third pass: Complete email bodies
4. Final pass: Polish tone and translations

### Tip 3: Providing Context

Give the AI examples from your existing templates and variable definitions:
- Include 2-3 existing templates as reference
- Provide your complete variables list with examples (from variables-library.csv)
- Specify your preferred tone/style
- Mention your industry/domain

**Example of providing variable context:**
```
Here are the variables available in our system with their example values:

name,description_fr,description_en,format,example
ClientName,Nom complet du client,Full client name,text,Marie Dubois
ProjectName,Nom du projet,Project name,text,Refonte du site web
QuoteAmount,Montant du devis,Quote amount,text,"50 000 $"
DeadlineDate,Date limite,Deadline date,date,2025-12-31

Please use ONLY these variables in your generated templates, and reference the example values when creating realistic content.
```

### Tip 4: Translation Quality

For critical content:
- Use AI for first draft
- Review by native speakers
- Pay attention to cultural nuances
- Test both languages in actual emails

### Tip 5: Variable Library First

Always generate/complete variables CSV before templates:
- Gives AI clear list of available variables
- Ensures consistent variable naming
- Reduces errors in template generation

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: AI Keeps Adding Explanations

**Solution:** Add to prompt:
```
CRITICAL: Return ONLY the CSV content. No explanations, no markdown, no code blocks. 
Start with the header row and end with the last data row. Nothing else.
```

### Problem: French Accents Display as �

**Solution:**
1. Ensure prompt specifies UTF-8 encoding
2. When saving AI output, explicitly choose UTF-8
3. Test file in text editor that shows encoding

### Problem: AI Changes Columns I Asked to Preserve

**Solution:** Make preservation requirement more explicit:
```
ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - DO NOT MODIFY:
The following columns must remain EXACTLY as provided:
- [column1]: Keep every single value unchanged
- [column2]: Do not edit, translate, or improve these values

Only modify/fill: [column3], [column4]
```

### Problem: Inconsistent Formatting Across Rows

**Solution:** Request consistency in prompt:
```
**Consistency Requirements:**
- All templates must follow the same structure
- French and English versions must mirror each other
- Maintain consistent formality level across all templates
- Use the same greeting/closing patterns
```

### Problem: Variable Names Don't Match

**Solution:** Provide explicit variable list:
```
**Variable Naming Rules:**
- Use EXACTLY these variable names (case-sensitive):
  - ClientName (not Client_Name, not clientName)
  - ProjectDeadline (not ProjectDeadLine, not Deadline)
  - QuoteAmount (not QuoteValue, not Amount)
```
